\"варианты\"), тем кто ранее не встречался с упомянутыми понятиями это может напоминать enum-ы.\nОни позволяют программисту описать такой тип данных, который может иметь различные формы,\nкаждый из различных \"вариантов\" такой формы будет обозначен (\"размечен\") некоторым тегом (названием/словом).\ntype point = float * float\ntype shape =\n  | Point of point\n  | Circle of point * float (* center and radius *)\n  | Rect of point * point (* lower-left and upper-right corners *)\n\nhttps://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/data/algebraic_data_types.html\n\nДалее можно обрабатывать вариант shape также как и любой другой тип - передавать его в функции, присваивать ...\nlet someShape = Circle ((0., 0.), 1.)\n\nlet center = function\n  | Point p -&gt; p\n  | Circle (p, _) -&gt; p\n  | Rect ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) -&gt; ((x2 +. x1) /. 2.0, (y2 +. y1) /. 2.0)\n\ncenter someShape (* вернёт центр окружности: (0., 0.) *)\n\nПолиморфные варианты\nПредставим более сложный пример:\nМы объявляем вариант описывающий виды некоторых животных, причём есть особый подтип животного, который имеет собственное имя\ntype animal = \n| Wolf\n| Tiger\n| Named of string\n\nТак же мы с помощью варианта ancestors описываем различных предков человека (предки человека формально тоже являются некоторым видом животных)\ntype ancestors =\n| HomoSapien\n| Neanderthal\n\nТеперь мы хотим получить валидное название для любого вида, и для этого мы вводим функцию string_of_animal:\nlet string_of_animal x = match x with\n| Wolf -&gt; \"wolf\"\n| Tiger -&gt; \"tiger\"\n| Named name -&gt; \"It's name is \" ^ name\n\nВыведенный тип функции будет: val string_of_animal : animal -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;\n\nвызов функции\nstring_of_animal (Named \"Cheburashka\");;\n\nвернёт нам:\n- : string = \"It's name is Cheburashka\" всё работает ожидаемо,\nно что если нам требуется функция,\nкоторая сможет вернуть валидную строку как для любого животного,\nтак и для предков человека?\n\nlet string_of_animal x = match x with\n| Wolf -&gt; \"wolf\"\n| Tiger -&gt; \"tiger\"\n| Named name -&gt; \"It's called \" ^ name;;\n| HomoSapien -&gt; \"homo sapien\"\n| Neanderthal -&gt; \"neanderthal\"\n(**\nError: This variant pattern is expected to have type firstHuman\n       The constructor Dog does not belong to type firstHuman\n*)\n\nТ.к. обычные варианты не поддерживают полиморфизм, компилятор не сможет вывести обобщённый тип для аргумента x функции string_of_animal.\nПолиморфные варианты\nИзначально полиморфные варианты планировалось добавить в качестве реализации \"типов объединения\" системы типизации в OCaml.\nТипы объединения особенно удобны для случаев когда мы работаем с разными наборами полиморфных данных.\nПереписав функцию string_of_animal, заменив \"обычные варианты\" на полиморфные,\nкомпилятор сможет вывести обобщённый тип для аргумента:\nlet string_of_beast x = match x with\n| `HomoSapien\t-&gt; \"homo sapien\"\n| `Neanderthal\t-&gt; \"neanderthal\"\n| `Dog\t\t\t-&gt; \"dog\"\n| `Cat\t\t\t-&gt; \"cat\"\n| `Named name \t-&gt; \"It's called \" ^ name;;\n\nОбобщённый тип:\nval string_of_beast :\n  [&lt; `Cat | `Dog | `HomoSapien | `Named of string | `Neanderthal ]\n    -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;\n\nПри выводе типов union types позволяют получить более \"точное\" (finer grained) разбиение типов, чем при использовании обычных ADT (вариантов).\nОднако существуют ограничения:\n\nнельзя использовать полиморфные варианты вместе с дженерик-типами\nсообщения об ошибках типизации очень длинные\n\n\n\n\nошибки типиизации часто очень длинные (с этим не очень понятно что делать)\nиногда выводятся не очень естественные типы\nПункт 2 как-то пофиксил Кастанья, и сказал, чтобы всё (3й пример) было зашибись нам нужен RTTI\nКоторый никогда не прибудет в мейнстримный OCaml.\nПоэтому было выбрано решение релизовать минимальное подмножество фщка с компиляцией куда-нить, где есть RTTI\nИ был выбран .NET а не JVM потому что студент более знаком с .NET\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01106.pdf (раздел 1. Introduction)\nТипы-Объединения в других ЯП\nВ других языках также существуют \"Типы объединения\" (Union Types), семантика которых соответствует объединению множеств.\nНапример в TypeScript их можно объявить с помощью значка \"|\" прямо в аннотации функции:\nfunction printId(id: number | string) { // Объединение: &lt;число&gt; ∪ &lt;строка&gt;\n  console.log(id);\n}\n\nПри передаче аргумента несоответствующего объединению\nprintId ([\"union type constraint error\"]);\n// ожидаем ошибку типизации в \"compile time\"\n\nбудет ошибка:\nArgument of type 'string[]' is not assignable\n    to parameter of type 'string | number'.\n  Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.\n\nЕсли попробовать вызвать метод который объявлен только у некоторых из причисленных в объединении типов \nfunction printId(id: number | string) { // Объединение: &lt;число&gt; ∪ &lt;строка&gt;\n  console.log(id.toUpperCase());\n}\n\nточно также будет ожидаемая ошибка:\nProperty 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.\n  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.\n\nтакой способ представления типов интуитивно ближе к представлению типов в качестве множеств, однако не для всех систем типов можно реализовать такой механизм.\nSemantic Subtyping\nWARNING: NOT READY\nThe distinguishing feature of a type system using SemanticSubtyping is that it has a set-theoretic model, in which types correspond directly to sets of values.\nMany recent type systems rely on a subtyping relation. Its definition generally depends on the type algebra, and on its intended use. We can distinguish two main approaches for defining subtyping: the syntactic approach and the semantic one. The syntactic approach -- by far the most widespread -- consists in defining the subtyping relation by axiomatising it in a formal system (a set of inductive or coinductive rules); in the semantic approach [...], instead, one starts with a model of the language and an interpretation of types as subsets of the model, then defines the subtyping relation as the inclusion of denoted sets, and, finally, when the relation is decidable, derives a subtyping algorithm from the semantic definition.\nУтверждается, что система (теоретико-множественная система типов - set-theoretic type system) хорошо подходит для типизации полиморфных вариантов.\nи выгодно отличается от того, который в настоящее время используется в OCaml.\nNote:\n\nUse the online reference of Supported TeX Functions\n\n","id":"https://m0rphed.github.io/notes/miniml-with-polymorphic-variants/","title":"Writing MiniML compiler to MS IL just to tinker with set-theoretic types"}},"docInfo":{"https://m0rphed.github.io/notes/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://m0rphed.github.io/notes/miniml-with-polymorphic-variants/":{"body":353,"title":9}},"length":2},"lang":"English"};
